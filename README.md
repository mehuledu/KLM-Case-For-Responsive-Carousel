# Responsive Carousel

## Motivation of my choice

I created a responsive and asynchronous carousel using Angular 4, Type script, HTML5 and CSS3.
Angular, which has always been my favorite JavaScript framework, decided to componentize everything
It is an independent carousel component which loads its content via HTTP service asynchronously.
It play automatically with given interval as well as with user navigation.

I have also created the HTML version of the carousel with pure CSS without using any JavaScript.
It is placed in folder `PureCSSResponsiveCarosuel` in project directory.
